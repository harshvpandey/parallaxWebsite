            <p>
                Hello friend. Hello friend? That's lame. Maybe I should give you a name. 
                But that's a slippery slope, you're only in my head, we have to remember that.
                 Shit, this actually happened, I'm talking to an imaginary person. What I'm about to tell you is top secret.
                  A conspiracy bigger than all of us. There's a powerful group of people out there that are secretly running the world.
                   I'm talking about the guys no one knows about, the ones that are invisible. 
                The top 1% of the top 1%, the guys that play God without permission. And now I think they're following me.

            <h2>Daemons</h2>
            <p>
                There's a saying. The devil's at his strongest when we're looking the other way, like a program running in the background silently,
                 while we're busy doing other shit. Daemons, they call them. They perform action without user interaction. Monitoring, logging, notifications. Primal urges, repressed memories, unconscious habits. They're always there, always active. We can try to make a difference, but it's all bullshit.
                 'Cause intentions are irrelevant. They don't drive us. Daemons do. And me? I've got more than most.

            <h2>The Reality Misconception</h2>
            <p>
                Is any of it real? I mean, look at this. Look at it! A world built on fantasy!
                 Synthetic emotions in the form of pills, psychological warfare in the form of advertising,
                  mind-altering chemicals in the form of food, brainwashing seminars in the form of media,
                   controlled isolated bubbles in the form of social networks. Real? You want to talk about reality?
                    We haven't lived in anything remotely close to it since the turn of the century. We turned it off,
                     took out the batteries, snacked on a bag of GMOs while
                      we tossed the remnants in the ever-expanding dumpster of the human condition.
                       We live in branded houses trademarked by corporations built on bipolar numbers jumping up and down on digital displays,
                        hypnotizing us into the biggest slumber mankind has ever seen.
